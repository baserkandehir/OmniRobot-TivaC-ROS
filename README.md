## General Info
A semi-autonomous omnidirectional experimental robotic platform. This repo includes the code for Tiva C side.

ROS compatibility is coming soon...

## Some Technical Details
* Microcontroller: ARM based 32-bit Cortex M4 TI Launchpad
* Actuation system: 12V DC Motors with high resolution magnetic encoders
* 3x PIDs are running to set speeds for three motors and another PID to control the position of the robot
* Body: Made out of aliminium
* 2x HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensors
